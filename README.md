Quick and messy ESP32 based robot with a WiFi management frame sniffer.

Built during BiteHack 2023 hardware hackathon to be used as a proof-of-concept aid for search and rescue parties helping in detection and localization of survivours by detecting WiFi network scans from their devices.

Not so proud about it - improper dynamic allocation abuse and possible long term heap segmentation issues ahead :)
